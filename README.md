# CatCalc Redux

My first Android Project, CatCalc from 2020, is now updated and rewritten for newer Android versions. It is a very simple calculator I made for myself for everyday use. Button size and text size is large so it's easy to use for both young and old users.

Created and built with Kotlin in Android Studio 2023.2.1. Minimum Android version is 10.0 (SDK 29).

## Installation

Download the apk from Releases and transfer it to your Android device. Locate the file with a file browser app and click it to install. You may need to give the file browser app installation permissions to complete the install.

## Features

"⤺" button: remove last character in text field.

"C" button: clear text field.

"⏲↩" button: restore last result to text field.

Example of percentage calculations:

```
10 - 20% = 8
```

Example of returning remainder:

```
10 % 3 = 1
```
