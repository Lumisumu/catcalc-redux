# CatCalc Redux

My first Android Project, CatCalc from 2020, is now updated and rewritten so I can build it for new Android versions. It is a very simple calculator I made for myself for everyday use.

Created and built with Kotlin in Android Studio 2023.1.1

Minimum Android version is 10.0 (SDK 29).
