# CatCalc Redux

My first Android Project, CatCalc from 2020, is now updated and rewritten so I can build it for new Android versions. It is a very simple calculator I made for myself for everyday use.

Created and built with Kotlin in Android Studio 2023.1.1

Minimum Android version is 10.0 (SDK 29).

## Percentage calculations

Percentage calculations are supported from version 1.3 onwards. Examples:

```
10 - 20% = 8
```

```
40 x 5% = 80
```
