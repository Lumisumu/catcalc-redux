# CatCalc Redux

My first Android Project, CatCalc from 2020, is now updated and rewritten for newer Android versions. It is a very simple calculator I made for myself for everyday use. Button size and text size is large so it's easy to use for both young and old users.

## User installation

Download the apk from Releases and transfer it to your Android device. Locate the file with a file browser app and click it to install. You may need to give the file browser app installation permissions to complete the install.

Minimum Android version: 10.0

## Features

"⤺" button: remove last character in text field.

"C" button: clear text field.

"⏲↩" button: restore last result to text field.

Example of percentage calculations:

```
10 - 20% = 8
```

Example of returning remainder:

```
10 % 3 = 1
```

## Installing the project

Download newest version of Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio

Download the repository contents and import the project to Android Studio.

Use SDK Manager to install "Android 10.0 ("Q")" SDK Platform version or newer.

Currently I'm using Android Studio Iguana 2023.2.1 and Kotlin to develop the app.
